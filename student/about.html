            <h4>Language Used</h4>
                <ul type="none">
                    <li><b>1)PHP:</b><br> Hypertext preprocessor is a server-side scripting language designed for web development,
                         but also used as general-purpose programming language. It was created in 1994, it is now produced
                         by PHP group. It can interact with many database languages including MySQL.</li><br>
                    <li><b>2)HTML:</b><br> HTML is a hypertext markup language which is, in reality, a spinal cord of any website.
                         Any website can’t be structured without the knowledge of HTML. If we make our web page only with the
                         help of HTML, then we can’t add many of the effective features in a web page, for making a web page
                         more effective we use various platforms such as static and dynamics methods. And here we are using
                         this language to make our web pages more effective as well as interactive for users to understand.
                         And to make our web pages dynamic we are using JavaScript and XML.</li><br>
                    <li><b>3)CSS:</b><br> CSS in PHP Stands for (Cascading Style Sheet). Cascading style sheets are used to format
                         the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define way of writing or style, size of various table,
                         and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a static  page's HTML. The main
                         work of CSS is to separate content of a web document (written in any markup language) that is written using
                         Cascading Style Sheets. There are lots of benefits that one can extract through this like improved content
                         accessibility, better flexibility and moreover, and hence gives a level of control over various presentation
                         characteristics of the document. It also helps in reducing the problems and helps in saving access time. It
                         gives the option of selecting various style schemes and rules according to the necessity.</li><br>
                    <li><b>4)PHP:</b><br> PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                         or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP
                         code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of
                         an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be
                         employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming
                         tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be
                         directly executed from the command line. </li><br>
                    <li><b>5)SQL(MySQL):</b><br> It is a structured query language used for querying database. Its function is to control the data
                         like storing and retrieving and data as requested by the software applications. </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>DevOps Tools</h4>
                <ul type="none">
                    <li><b>1)Visual Studio:</b><br> Microsoft Visual Studio is a powerful IDE that ensures quality code throughout the entire application
                         lifecycle, from design to deployment. Whether you’re developing applications for SharePoint, the web, Windows, Windows Phone, and
                         beyond, Visual Studio is one of ultimate all-in-one solution.</li><br>
                    <li><b>2)XAMPP:</b><br> XAMPP is an abbreviation for cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl, and it allows you to build WordPress site
                         offline, on a local web server on your computer. This simple and lightweight solution works on Windows, Linux, and Mac – hence the
                         “cross-platform” part. Since WordPress isn’t a stand-alone application, XAMPP provides two essential components for its installation
                         – Apache, which is used to create the local server, and MySQL which you can use as a database for your website.</li>
